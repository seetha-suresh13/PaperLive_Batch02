K8s Services
------------------------
To access the application that is running inside a pod, we will use K8s Services.
POD Manifest File	---- Information related to the creation of pod
SERVICE Manifest File ---- Information related to accessing the application which is there inside the pod

Labels
A label is a key-value pair which is attached to the k8s objects (Pod, deployment, service...)
To identify and group all the pods belonging to the same application
metadata:
	labels:
		app: my-app/Zomato/swiggy/hotstar
		env: dev/test/prod

Selector
It is used to select the pods which have same labels
A selector is used to filter the k8s objects based on their labels

selector:
	app: my-app/Zomato/swiggy/hotstar
	env: dev/test/prod

Ports:
NodePort		- expose the service outside the cluster
port			- port of a service (not mandatory)
targetPort	- container port (inside the pod)

K8s Service Types;
1. Cluster IP			- to access the application within the cluster. will generate unique IP address (Static IP). clusterIP will not change if 							the pod is recreated
2. NodePort			- it is used to access the application outside of the cluster. when we select the service type as nodeport, by default k8s 							assigns a port ranging between 30000-32767
							nodePort: 31000
3. LoadBalancer		- it is used to access the application outside of the cluster. k8s will create a load balancer in the aws cloud
4. Headless Service		- clusterIP: none

#!/bin/bash

# Update package manager repositories
sudo apt-get update

# Install necessary dependencies
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl

# Create directory for Docker GPG key
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings

# Download Docker's GPG key
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Ensure proper permissions for the key
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add Docker repository to Apt sources
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Update package manager repositories
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin 


Write the manifest file for Zomato App using Service Type as Load Balancer

------------------------
Namespaces
------------------------
If you want to create the k8s resources in an isolated environment we will use "namespace" concept
dev --- dev ns
test --- test ns
devops --- devops ns

-----------------------
K8s Controllers
-----------------------
To provide self healing capability (High Availability) to our app we will use K8s controllers
A controller in k8s will help us to run the required number of pods at any given time by maintaining HA

Types of K8s controllers;
	- ReplicationController
	- ReplicaSet
	- Deployment
	- StatefulSet
	- DaemonSet

- ReplicationController 5 --- 4 --- 5
It ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time
If a pod fails/deleted, RC will create a new pod in the place of delete pod
RC will takecare of pod lifecycle
Using RC we can scale up and scale down the number pods
