Playbooks;
Playbook contains tasks
Playbook is a collection of multiple modules
We can execute multiple modules at the same time
We can reuse the playbook
Playbooks are written using YML
Extension as .yml or .yaml
Ansible playbook will start with --- and ends with ...
Playbook is case sensitive 

Write a playbook to setup nginx and to start nginx with custom <Message Print>

================
SETUP Module
================
This module will show the system info about the worker nodes

================
ANSIBLE TAGS
================
20 tasks --- 5 tasks --- Ansible tags
Tags are used to execute or skip specific tasks


================
VARIABLES
================
a = kastro
b = kiran
c = devops engineer
d = devops trainer

The concept of using variable is, in future if i want to change the tool/package, i can only change the variable assigned the value

Static		- defined inside the playbook
Dynamic		- not defined inside the playbook

================
LOOPS
================
Loops are used to reduce the lines of code
install 10 tools --- we need to write 10 tasks ----> instead of this, i will use loops concept

===============================
Writing playbook using Adhoc Commands
===============================
SHELL
COMMAND
RAW

With the help of raw module, we can directly work with worker nodes "without installing python on master node"
